Sometimes I bump into a wonderful piece of code and think:

> Wow, this is such an amazing code!

A few days later maybe I stumble upon the very same code and think:

> What the hell? This code is a maze! Whoever wrote it should be in jail by now! 

The truth is **I'm really glad to be free**.

### Ok, that was (kind of) funny, but why would I follow your blog?

Did you ever get lost in your own code? If the answer is yes, this blog is for you!

Besides my lack of originality in choosing a better title, I will use this blog to write about things I find interesting. After all, if I can blog about something, chances are I actually got it...or maybe not!
